"""User manual:
First install Pillow using 'pip install Pillow'. If that does not work, exit the IDLE and re-open it and try again. If that does not work, use 'pip install Pillow -v'. 

After installing Pillow the program should be able to be run.

To use the program, run it. After running it you will get a screen with 4 buttons, 3 green ones "Chicken", "Beef", and "Pork". And then a red button with the text "Exit".
Along with the buttons there shoudl be text at the top reading "Welcome to the the program! Click one of the buttons to see nutritional information:"

To use the program, click one of the 3 green buttons.
Once you click one of the green buttons, another window will be opened.
In the new window you will see text that says "Enter weight (lbs):"
Under that text, there should be an open area to enter a number.
Under the open area to enter a number, there are three labels "Calories:", "Grams of Protein:", and "Grams of Fat:".
Underneath those three labels there is a "Calculate" button.
To use the program, enter a number of pounds into the entry area under "Enter weight (lbs):" then click the "Calculate" button.
You should see the "Calories:", "Grams of Protein", and "Grams of Fat:" labels change to display the Calories, Grams of Protein, and Grams of Fat
Observe that information, which tells you how many calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat are in the amount of pounds that you entered for the meat that you chose.
This can be repeated an infinite amount of times.
To exit, you may look in the upper left corner and see a red "X" button, click it and the window will close.

These steps may be repeated to use the program multiple times, and to check the nutritional content of chicken, beef, and pork.
To exit the program, click on the 4th red label on the first window that opened when the program was run.
After that the program will close, and will need to be ran again to be used.
